# Air-Quality-Dashboard

🌍 Air Quality Matters! 🌍

Excited to share a dashboard I created to visualize and analyze air quality data. This interactive tool provides a clear view of key metrics, such as the AQI (Air Quality Index) and pollutant levels across different regions, helping raise awareness about air quality.

Using Power BI, I designed the dashboard to make complex data easy to understand, supporting everyone from policymakers to community members in making informed decisions. The insights reveal crucial trends and hotspots, emphasizing the importance of actionable steps for a cleaner, healthier environment.

Check out the dashboard for a glimpse into the data driving our understanding of air quality! 🌱📊
